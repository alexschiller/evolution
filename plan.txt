The intention for this project is to be a top down or side view sandbox
where small creatures (pixels?) with AI can grow and attempt to learn to cooperate.

To start creatures will have:
1. Size
2. Hunger (movement uses hunger)
3. Health
4. Speed
5. Color

Same color pixels will be able to reproduce at the cost of hunger
