The intention for this project is to be a top down or side view sandbox
where small creatures (pixels?) with AI can grow and attempt to learn to cooperate.

To start creatures will have:
1. Size
2. Hunger (movement uses hunger)
3. Health
4. Speed
5. Color

Same color pixels will be able to reproduce at the cost of hunger

The current problem I'm facing is how to implement positive and negative reinforcement. 
I think each object needs to store logs of its behavior to try and see if what they are doing is successful. How contextually bound should this information be? For example, will the creature learn to turn right all the time or only when turning right is meaningful? This is going to take some more though before I can start an implimentation that will work.
